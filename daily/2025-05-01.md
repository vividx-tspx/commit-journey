# 🌱 Commit Journey — vividx-tspx

Hi there!  
I'm Vividx, and this repository is my daily journey as I grow, learn, and explore the world of data and code.

## ✨ Why I Do This

Every day, I make one commit — big or small — to remind myself that consistency beats intensity.  
Someday, I’ll print my GitHub contribution graph as a piece of art 💚

## 💬 A Quote I Love

> *"Studying every day is more important than studying hard for a few days and then giving up."*  

This reminds me that even on days I feel I did nothing great, showing up still matters.
