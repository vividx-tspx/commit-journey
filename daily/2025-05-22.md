# Back from the Storm â€“ 2025-05-22

Itâ€™s been a rough few days.

I had to step away due to an intense flare-up of gastritis and colitis â€” a full stop I didnâ€™t see coming. For a while, my only task was to rest, recover, and wait. And thatâ€™s what I did.

But today, Iâ€™m back.

Not with force. Not to sprint. But to move forward â€” with gentleness and clarity.

## ğŸ©º Health First

- Iâ€™m out of the hospital.
- Still weak, but no longer in pain.
- Feeling like Iâ€™ve been rebooted â€” clean, slow, intentional.

---

## ğŸ’» First Steps Back

- Opened the workspace `VIVIDX-TSPX` after days away.
- Wrote this daily log as a quiet commit to myself.
- No coding today â€” just showing up again, and thatâ€™s enough.

## ğŸ’­ Reflections

**Progress isn't linear. Healing isnâ€™t linear.**

Every version of me that paused, got sick, or fell behind â€” they still count. Because they returned.

Iâ€™m learning to rebuild my rhythm, not resume the old one.

## ğŸŒ± Letâ€™s Begin (Again)

This commit marks a comeback. A quiet one.

No pressure to be perfect. No rush to catch up. Just a single step forward.

> "Rebuild. Reroute. But never retreat."
